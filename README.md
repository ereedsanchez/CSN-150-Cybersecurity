Class Participation/Attendance:  
Class attendance and participation are significant components of the learning process and play a major role in determining overall student academic achievement. Therefore, students are strongly encouraged to attend and participate in all class sessions of the course in which they are registered. The maximum number of excused absence hours is limited to one more class hour than the contact hours. For example, a student enrolled in a class that meets five hours per week is allowed six hours of absence (not six days). Final grades will be lowered ½ grade for each class hour absence thereafter. Late arrivals (10-30 minutes) to class will be considered ½ class hours absence. Arrivals after 30 minutes may, at the discretion of instructor, be marked absent for the entire class hours.
